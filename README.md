*People, Places & Things:*
Eric and John laid the groundwork for SHIFTYPIXELS with a missing group member and a lifesucking void. Our presentation was Mostly Eric and I, the lifesucking void also explained their contributions in great detail. As the project encountered issues a beta version was created to salvage a working product about 30 commits behind its predeccesor. With Zac the TA as support, John managed to fix the broken mess to publish a beta application.
