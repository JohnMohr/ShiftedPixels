## **Contributing**
    
*People, Places & Things:*
Eric and John laid the groundwork for SHIFTYPIXELS with a missing group member and a Lifesucking Void. Our presentation was Mostly Eric and John, the Lifesucking Void also explained their contribution in ~~great~~ detail. As the project encountered issues a beta version was created to salvage a working product about 30 commits behind its predeccesor. 
The future looked grim.
Zac 'the TA' Stowell entered the fray with a level 10 Support skill, allowing John an attack of opportunity to fix the broken mess and publish a beta application.
